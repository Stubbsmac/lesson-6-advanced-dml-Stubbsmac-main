# CIS250_Create06_Advanced DML
For this assignment you will be using a jupyter notebook to expand your DML scripting capabilities. We will be learning about programmatic tools like Transactions, Printing an output, and TRY/CATCH. You will once again be using the Airport and Storage Rental database tables for these queries. To assist with query creation, the documentation for both of these tables has been added to the repo. There have been no changes to their structure since the last assignment. There is a set of exercises and a scenario at the end of the starter file that will be graded. The rest of the jupyter notebook file is for you to practice and prepare for the graded exercises. The scenario this week is lengthy, so be sure to set aside ample time.

## If Something Goes Wrong
Please contact your instructor if something goes wrong. Since we are doing exercises that effect the integrity of the data in your databases there may be operations that you are not able to undo. If you delete or alter data in your database in an unintended way, please reach out as soon as you possible.
